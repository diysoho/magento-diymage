                    <p>Bought this and GH2 yesterday and am absolutely blown away by the remastering job. Bob Ludwig has 'done a Beatles' and subtly brought out clarity and opened up the soundscape and not turned everything up to 10 (thank all that is good and mighty). Really looking forward to the remastered versions of the albums-UNiversal do a good job with their deluxe editions so hopefully a treat of bonus tracks etc. Hope they don't tag them on to the original album but do them as a second disc. Particularly crossing fingers that the BBC Christmas 1977 interview to accompany News of the World can be sourced and included; oh and that 'Live Killers' is included in the release schedule.</p>

                    <p>This greatest hit compilation has already been re-released at least 20 times (including remastered editions), not to talk about other "best of" like Absolute Greatest. The only difference here is that the Parlophone pound sterling logo has been replaced by the Island palm tree logo as indeed Queen moved from EMI to Universal. This re-release brings nothing new, no B-side, no extended version, no rare track, while Queen has a lot of unreleased material (e.g Hyde Park 76) in the vaults.</p>

                    <p>Why an unreleased version of "Show Must Go On" by Elton John appeared on this album with a remix of "Under Pressure" when the original had already appeared on Hits II is a mystery, as is the inclusion of the non-single version of Freddie's "Living On My Own". Oh and don't mention Wyclef John!!!
All but one of the later Queen singles (picking up where Hits II left off) are here but they only make up 6 out of the 17 tracks, although the album does redeem itself slightly by retrospectively including "Thank God its Christmas" and the superb "Las Palabras de Amor" which had for some reason been left off Hits II.</p> 
                    <p>But despite the success of the solo tracks and the collaborations this should have been the opportunity to mop up the hits/tracks omitted from the previous two albums and as a result of failing to do so, songs including "Spread Your Wings", "Tie Your Mother Down", "Scandal" and "A Winter's Tale" may never get the wider audience they deserve. Shame!</p>

                    <p>I must admit to having been quite excited about this compiliation but, alas, it did not live up to my expectations. The Queen + idea was a big mistake. The tracks featuring other atrists are, on the whole, a waste of time. The solo tracks seem to have been chosen at random and without any sort of criteria. Why, for instance does 'Living On My Own' feature, considering there are probably half a dozen songs at least in Freddie Mercury's back catolouge that are better and why does Roger Taylor not get a solo track on there whilst Brian May does? There are some admirable selections (such as 'Words of Love' and 'Days of Our Lives') but, ultimately, Greatest Hits III is patchy at best. This disc could have been a genuine Hits album - including unfairly neglected songs such as Tie Your Mother Down, Keep Yourself Alive etc. - but it isn't. A great shame.</p>

                <div class="description"> 
                    <p>Following the tragic and untimely demise of the wonderful Freddie Mercury in 1991, Queen the band adored by myself and millions ended. Anything else following on from that fateful day going by the name of Queen but devoid of Freddie's dazzling input is a cheap money making tool and an insult to the great man's memory. Greatest Hits III fits the bill superbly. Queen was always the musical mainstay of the four individuals concerned, their solo works were fantastic (especially Freddie's 'Barcelona' album) but always completely separate, compiling them under the Queen umbrella is just a cheap cash in. They were never meant to be Queen singles thats why they were done outside the band. Adding to this Elton John's appaling 'several keys lower' version of The Show Must Go On, the dispicable 'Rah mix' of Under Pressure (the original was perfect so why do it ?) and of coarse the deplorable Another One Bites The Dust with Wyclef Jean. It despairs me to think how the remaining members of Queen thought this album to be a good idea. If we want Queen it's all there readily available on disc as it always has been. If we want more Queen then let Parlophone dig out something from the vaults and put together a package like The Beatles Anthologies. Let's not drag Queen past it's foregone conclusion with new tours and recordings and desperate compilations done to attract a younger audience for a few extra bucks in the coffers, it won't work. Instead let's look at Queen in retrospect and revel in what it WAS, not what it IS. Don't buy this album, if you like Queen start with the original album 'Queen' and work you're way up, you won't be dissapointed. Enjoy the solo work seperately as it was intended and you won't go far wrong. The artwork with the album is expertly done and the quality of much of the music is excellent, it just should not have been compiled as a Queen album, the concept is wrong. For this reason I give the album 1 star</p>
